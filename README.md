# Insurance-Data-Analysis
EDA and linear regression is performed on the data set.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Load and inspect the data: Check for missing values, outliers, and the distribution of the data.
Analyze the target variable: Plot a histogram or bar graph to understand the distribution of the target variable.
Feature Analysis: Plot histograms or bar graphs for each feature and observe the distribution of each feature. Plot pair plots to see relationships between different features.
Correlation Analysis: Plot a heatmap of the correlation matrix to observe the relationship between the features.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and clean the data if necessary.

Linear Regression:

Split the data into training and test datasets.
Train the Linear Regression model using the training data.
Evaluate the model using the test data and calculate evaluation aspects such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Plot the regression line on a scatter plot to observe the relationship between the target and the predictor variables.
Fine-tune the model by modifying the features and regularization strength.
Make predictions on new data using the trained model.
